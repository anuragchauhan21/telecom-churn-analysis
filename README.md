![](https://github.com/anuragchauhan21/garage/blob/main/churn_by_services.png)
This project explores **customer churn behavior** for a telecom company using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The goal is to uncover patterns and factors that influence why customers leave the service, and to generate actionable business recommendations.

---

## 📌 Objective

To analyze customer behavior and service usage patterns to:
- Identify key churn drivers
- Segment customers by churn risk
- Provide strategic recommendations to reduce churn

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Google Colab

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Churn rate is approximately **26.5%**.
- **Senior citizens** and **month-to-month contract users** are more likely to churn.
- **Electronic check** users show much higher churn than other payment methods.
- Churn is highest during the **initial months of tenure**.
- Users with **fewer services (0–3)** churn more often, while those with **6+ services** tend to stay.

---

## ✅ Business Recommendations

- **Support and retain senior customers** through simplified plans and better engagement.
- **Promote long-term contracts** with offers and incentives.
- **Improve service quality** (e.g., Fiber Optic) and offer value bundles.
- **Address high-churn segments** early, especially new and medium-risk customers.
- **Simplify payment options** and encourage switching from electronic checks.
